## 💡 The Problem
Small online business owners in Bangladesh suffer from **"Profit Blindness."**
* **Manual Entry:** Copying messy text from Messenger to Excel takes hours.
* **Hidden Costs:** They often forget to subtract Delivery (60/120 Tk), Ads, and Packaging from the sale price.
* **Banglish Chaos:** Customer messages are a mix of Bangla and English (e.g., *"Bhai 017... Mirpur a pathan"*), which standard software cannot read.

## ✅ The Solution: MunafaOS
MunafaOS acts as a "Bridge" between unstructured chat messages and structured financial data.

### Key Features
* **🧠 Intelligent Parser:** Automatically detects Name, Phone, and Address from raw "Banglish" text.
* **📍 Location Intelligence:** Auto-detects neighborhoods (e.g., "Uttara", "Savar") to assign the correct delivery charge (Inside/Outside Dhaka).
* **💰 Profit Autopsy:** A real-time dashboard showing exactly where money is lost (Ads vs. Delivery vs. Product Cost).
* **🔒 Security First:** Built with Row-Level Security (RLS) so users own their data. Includes GDPR-compliant "Delete Account" features.
* **📈 Visual Analytics:** Interactive Pie Charts and Stat Cards to visualize business health.
